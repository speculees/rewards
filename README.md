## ‚ö° Recommended Workflow for running the demo app

1. **Develop components in `libs/ui`** with Rewards DS demo app.

   ```sh
   pnpm nx link-ui rewards-ds
   ```

    The app will use styles and components from the UI library. These components are pre-compiled. The link command will also link the UI library into the demo app dependencies. See root node_modules folder.

2. Serve the app:

   ```sh
   pnpm nx serve rewards-ds
   ```

---

## ‚ö° Recommended Workflow for running the storybook UI library

1. **Develop components in `libs/ui`** with Storybook.

   ```sh
   pnpm nx storybook ui 
   ```

  The app will use styles and components from the UI library.
  The components will be compiled with Storybook.

## üõ† Tips

- Use **Nx Console** in VS Code for a friendly GUI to run tasks without remembering CLI syntax.
- Use `--configuration=production` or `--configuration=development` for explicit build modes.
- You can run multiple targets in parallel:

  ```sh
  pnpm nx run-many --target=build --projects=ui,rewards-ds
  ```
